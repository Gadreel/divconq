 /**
 * This package provides very lightweight XML support - useful if you don't care about NameSpaces
 * or knowing what your parent element is.  Not a fan of DOM but interested in something like it?
 * 
 * Read XML content with {@link divconq.xml.XmlReader} and write it with {@link divconq.xml.XmlWriter}.
