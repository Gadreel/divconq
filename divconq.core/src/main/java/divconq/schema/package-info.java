 /**
  * <p>
  * dcSchema is a data type validation system for JSON like structures (lists,
  * objects, values).  It is used to define and validate types that are based 
  * on {@link divconq.struct}.  All services in DivConq require a schema
  * definition and data will be validated before a service is called,
  * taking some of the input validation pressure off the service.
