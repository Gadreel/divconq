 * name=value tokens or the like, and inserting these pairs into 
 * the internal map. This type of parser is useful as it exposes all
 * pairs extracted using the <code>java.util.Map</code> interface
 * and as such can be used with the Java collections framework. The
 * internal map used by this is a <code>Hashtable</code>, however
 * subclasses are free to assign a different type to the map used.
