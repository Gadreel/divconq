/** 
 * The <code>Address</code> interface is used to represent a generic
 * uniform resource identifier. This interface allows each section 
 * of the uniform resource identifier to be represented. A generic
 * uniform resource identifier syntax is represented in RFC 2616 
 * section 3.2.2 for the HTTP protocol, this allows similar URI's
 * for example ftp, http, https, tftp. The syntax is
 * <code><pre>
 *
 *    URI = [scheme "://"] host [ ":" port ] [ path [ "?" query ]]
 *
 * </pre></code>
 * This interface represents the host, port, path and query part
 * of the uniform resource identifier. The parameters are also 
 * represented by the URI. The parameters in a URI consist of name 
 * and value pairs in the path segment of the URI.
 * <p>
 * This will normalize the path part of the uniform resource
 * identifier. A normalized path is one that contains no back
 * references like "./" and "../". The normalized path will not
 * contain the path parameters.
