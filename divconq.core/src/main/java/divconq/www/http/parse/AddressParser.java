/**
 * This parser is used to parse uniform resource identifiers.
 * The uniform resource identifier syntax is given in RFC 2396.
 * This parser can parse relative and absolute URI's. The
 * uniform resource identifier syntax that this parser will
 * parse are based on the generic web based URL similar to
 * the syntax represented in RFC 2616 section 3.2.2. The syntax
 * used to parse this URI is a modified version of RFC 2396
 * <pre>
 *
 *    URI         = (absoluteURI | relativeURI)
 *    absoluteURI = scheme ":" ("//" netpath | relativeURI)
 *    relativeURI = path ["?" querypart]
 *    netpath     = domain [":" port] relativeURI
 *    path        = *("/" segment)
 *    segment     = *pchar *( ";" param )
 *
 * </pre>
 * This implements the <code>Address</code> interface and provides
 * methods that access the various parts of the URI. The parameters
 * in the path segments of the uniform resource identifier are
 * stored in name value pairs. If parameter names are not unique
 * across the path segments then only the deepest parameter will be
 * stored from the path segment. For example if the URI represented
 * was <code>http://domain/path1;x=y/path2;x=z</code> the value for
 * the parameter named <code>x</code> would be <code>z</code>.
 * <p>
 * This will normalize the path part of the uniform resource
 * identifier. A normalized path is one that contains no back
 * references like "./" and "../". The normalized path will not
 * contain the path parameters.
 * <p>
 * The <code>setPath</code> method is used to reset the path this
 * uniform resource identifier has, it also resets the parameters.
 * The parameters are extracted from the new path given.
