/**
 * This is used to parse a path given as part of a URI. This will  read the
 * path, normalize it, and break it up into its components. The normalization
 * of the path is the conversion of the path given into it's actual path by
 * removing the references to the parent directories and to the current dir.
 * <p>
 * If the path that this represents is <code>/usr/bin/../etc/./README</code>
 * then the actual path, normalized, is <code>/usr/etc/README</code>. Once
 * the path has been normalized it is possible to acquire the segments as
 * an array of strings, which allows simple manipulation of the path.
 * <p>
 * Although RFC 2396 defines the path within a URI to have parameters this
 * does not extract those parameters this will simply normalize the path and
 * include the path parameters in the path. If the path is to be converted
 * into a OS specific file system path that has the parameters extracted 
 * then the <code>AddressParser</code> should be used.
