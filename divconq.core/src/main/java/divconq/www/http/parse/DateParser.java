/** 
 * This is used to create a <code>Parser</code> for the HTTP date format. 
 * This will parse the 3 formats that are acceptable for the HTTP/1.1 date. 
 * The three formats that are acceptable for the HTTP-date are  
 * <pre>
 * Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
 * Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
 * Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This can also parse the date in ms as retrived from the <code>System</code>'s 
 * <code>System.currentTimeMillis</code> method. This has a parse method for a 
 * <code>long</code> which will do the same as the <code>parse(String)</code>. 
 * Once the date has been parsed there are two methods that allow the date 
 * to be represented, the <code>toLong</code> method converts the date to a 
 * <code>long</code> and the <code>toString</code> method will convert the date 
 * into a <code>String</code>.
 * <p>
 * This produces the same string as the <code>SimpleDateFormat.format</code> 
 * using the pattern <code>"EEE, dd MMM yyyy hh:mm:ss 'GMT'"</code>. This will
 * however do the job faster as it does not take arbitrary inputs.
