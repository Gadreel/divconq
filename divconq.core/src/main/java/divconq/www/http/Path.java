 * The <code>Path</code> represents the path part of a URI. This provides 
 * the various components of the URI path to the user. The normalization
 * of the path is the conversion of the path given into it's actual path by
 * removing the references to the parent directories and to the current dir.
 * <p>
 * If the path that this represents is <code>/usr/bin/../etc/./README</code>
 * then the actual path, normalized, is <code>/usr/etc/README</code>. Once
 * the path has been normalized it is possible to acquire the segments as
 * an array of strings, which allows simple manipulation of the path.
