DivConq Framework
=================

DivConq is a File Transfer Application Framework that aims at addressing:

* File Transfers with external entities via HTTP(S), SFTP and FTP(S).
* File Transfers through the DMZ using a Gateway
* File Tasks including scheduled tasks and triggered tasks
* File/deposit validation framework
* High level scripting for managing file workflow
* Very flexible and extensiable Web User Interface
* Very flexible and extensiable server components
* Built-in support for OpenPGP

Ultimately the goal is to support the creation of a custom file transfer and 
validation solution with a little custom code as possible.  Yet at the same
time for the custom solution to exactly meet your needs, not just be a 
minor modification from some template.

Status
------

Currently the framework is in early beta testing and only supports a handful of
the features we plan to implement.  At present we have a demo for the following:

* File Transfers with external entities via HTTP(S).
* File Transfers through the DMZ using a Gateway
